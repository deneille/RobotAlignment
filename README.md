# RL Interpretability 

## Interactive Learning

Several studies have documented the impact of interactivity and teaching/learning. By conducting this research, we wanted to add an interesting lense to promote Reinforcement Learning interpretability in a digestible way. 
This is why we thought of this game.This game is meant to be an add on to [our resource](https://rl-and-misalignment.streamlit.app/). Please feel free to check it along witha live version of this game.

## Story

This game begins with robots working together on the assembly line in a factory. However, one day, other robots began to misbehave, causing chaos and confusion. It seems that only one robot is still functioning correctly. The factory manager has asked it to help the robot re-train its fellowkind. Your task is to help the robot re-train its fellowkind correctly.

To do this, you need to face off against the other robots in a knowledge battle. You will be asked a series of questions, and you must answer them correctly within the time limit. If you answer correctly, the robot will return to its green original state. If you fail, the robot will remain in its malfunctioning state and you will need to try again. To be successful in this game, you need to help the robot re-train all the robots.

Beware of the robots destroying the factory inventory in the process. If they are successful, this spells disaster for you.
