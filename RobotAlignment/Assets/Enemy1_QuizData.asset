  questions:
  - In reinforcement learning, agents learn by interacting with an environment and
    receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions.
  - In the resource, the Blackjack agent was trained using a policy-based method.
  - Goal misgeneralization can occur even when the reward function is correctly specified.

  correctAnswers:
  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns
    to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties from
    its environment. The goal is to maximize total rewards over time.
  - In the resource, the Blackjack agent was trained using a value-based method (Q-learning).
  - Goal Misgeneralization (GMG) occurs when an RL agent competently achieves a goal
    that's correlated with, but different from, the intended objective. This because
    the agent has mastered achieving this reward, just not necessarily correctly.
